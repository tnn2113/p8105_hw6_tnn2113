This is my solution to HW6.

## Problem 2

Load and clean birth weight dataset

``` r
birthweight_df = 
  read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    malform = as.factor(malform),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace)
  )
```

From my knowledge, the mother’s age and pre-pregnancy BMI can be the
determinants of the baby’s birth weight. I am interested in
investigating the relationship between the mother’s physique at delivery
+ the baby’s gender and baby’s birth weight.

``` r
proposed_model = lm(bwt ~ babysex + momage + ppbmi, data = birthweight_df)
```
